## Inspiration

- Our team's dedication to environmental conservation and tree planting has been the driving force behind our game development.
- We took cues from Forestapp's mix of gaming and tree planting to create games that promote eco-awareness and good habits.
- Inspired by Lumosity, we love the concept of a main goal, and then the user can develop it by playing multiple mini-games.
- Our goal is simple: entertain players while encouraging a love for nature and boosting mental skills.
